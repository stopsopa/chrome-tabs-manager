# Privacy Policy for Chrome Tabs Manager

**Effective Date: December 2, 2025**

## Introduction

Chrome Tabs Manager is a Chrome extension designed to help you organize your browser tabs and windows. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This policy explains how our extension handles your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Do NOT Collect

Chrome Tabs Manager does **NOT** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to external servers.

- We do **not** track your browsing history.
- We do **not** collect your search queries.
- We do **not** collect any personal identification information.
- We do **not** use any third-party analytics services.

### Local Data Usage

The extension operates entirely locally on your device. It accesses the following information solely to provide its functionality:

1.  **Open Tabs and Windows**: To display your current browsing session, identify duplicates, and allow you to reorganize tabs.
2.  **Bookmarks**: To allow you to save tabs to your bookmarks and to check if tabs are already saved.
3.  **Favicons**: To display the icons of the websites you have open.

### Local Data Storage

We use your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage`) to save your preferences, such as:

- The last used dimensions of the extension popup.
- Your preferred folder path for saving bookmarks.
- Interface settings (e.g., confirmation dialog preferences).

This data never leaves your browser and is not shared with anyone.

## Data Security

Since Chrome Tabs Manager does not transmit data to any external servers, your data remains as secure as your local device and browser.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the extension or the Chrome Web Store listing.
