# Chrome Tabs Manager

**Organize your browser chaos.**

Chrome Tabs Manager is a powerful extension designed to help you tame tab overload across multiple windows. It acts as a bridge between your active browsing sessions and your long-term bookmark storage, ensuring you never lose track of important pages while keeping your workspace clean.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Window Overview**: See all your open tabs grouped by window in a single, compact view.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Instantly spot and clean up duplicate tabs across all your windows.
- **Smart Sync**: Intelligently match your open windows with existing bookmark folders. The extension tells you which tabs are already saved and which are missing.
- **One-Click Organization**: Save entire windows to bookmarks with automatic date-based naming, or sync new tabs to existing folders.
- **Drag & Drop**: Easily move tabs between windows or create new windows just by dragging.
- **Context Menu**: Quick access to close tabs, move them, or save them directly from the list.

## Why use it?

If you're a "tab hoarder" who keeps multiple windows open for different projects, this tool helps you:

1.  **De-clutter**: Close windows safely knowing your tabs are saved.
2.  **Consolidate**: Merge scattered tabs into organized bookmark folders.
3.  **Focus**: Keep only what you need open, without losing what you might need later.
